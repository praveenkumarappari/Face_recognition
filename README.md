Here in this Opencv, Numpy and Pickle libraries are used.
cv2 version - 4.1.0
numpy version - 1.16.4
pickle version - 4.0
Here libraries are used with their compatable versions.


cascades are used here in order recognize specific parts of face in the frame.
In this API(facerecognize-train) data is trained in order to recognize the face. Before running the main program we need to run the
